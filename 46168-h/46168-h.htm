  <h2 class='c004'>THE<br />PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><i>The following Sheets were not
intended to be made publick, but
as part of the Philosophical Transactions.
As those Works are printed in the
order of Time they are read; these Observations,
communicated to the</i> <span class='sc'>Royal
Society</span> <i>at different Meetings, would,
upon that Account, have been publish'd
separate in different Numbers of those
Transactions. To satisfy therefore the
Impatience of several learned and very
valuable Friends, to whose Importunities
I have neither Will, nor Inclination
to deny any thing in my Power to
grant, I caused a few Copies to be printed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_ii' id='Page_ii'>ii</a></span>
that the whole might be seen together,
and then broke up the Press. This
has excited the Curiosity of the Publick,
and raised a Demand for these Experiments
much beyond what I had reason
to expect. I therefore found it necessary
to send them to the Press a second Time,
lest some of those over-officious Gentlemen,
who are always ready on these
Occasions, should do it for me; so that
whoever has an Inclination, may now be
made acquainted, by what Means the
several surprizing Phænomena of Electricity
have been brought about.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>I chose to lay these Papers before
the Publick in the same Dress wherein
they appeared before the very honourable
and learned Body, to whom,
as the various Effects of Electricity presented
themselves, they were regularly
communicated, and from whom they
met with a very favourable Reception.
Many Members of the</i> <span class='sc'>Royal Society</span>,
<i>as well as several other Persons of great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_iii' id='Page_iii'>iii</a></span>
Rank and Quality, have been repeated
Witnesses of the Facts which are here
laid before the World; particularly the
present worthy President</i>, <span class='sc'>Martin
Folkes</span>, Esq; <i>whose extensive Abilities
and great Knowledge in every Branch
of useful Literature are exceeded only by
his Candour and Zeal in promoting Science.
The Advice and Assistance of this
Gentleman, whose Friendship I shall always
esteem as one of the greatest Happinesses
of my Life, has been of great
Moment in the Prosecution of these Discoveries.
I therefore take this publick
Manner of testifying my sincerest Obligations
as well to him, as to Sir</i> <span class='sc'>Hans
Sloane</span>, Bart. <i>who, although retired
from Business, is nevertheless attentive
to whatever tends to the Advancement
of Philosophy. Upon a Report made to
him of these Experiments and Observations,
he, as surviving Executor of Sir</i>
<span class='sc'>Godfrey Copley</span>, <i>was pleased to
appoint me last Year to receive the annual
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_iv' id='Page_iv'>iv</a></span>
Prize-medal of Gold, given by the</i>
<span class='sc'>Royal Society</span> <i>in consequence of Sir</i>
<span class='sc'>Godfrey's</span> <i>Benefaction. The Honour
of being so particularly taken notice of
by Gentlemen of such distinguished Merit,
as it cannot but give me the highest
Pleasure, so shall it ever continue to
raise in me Sentiments of the truest
Gratitude, and most profound Respect.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>IF it should be asked, to what useful
Purposes the Effects of Electricity
can be applied, it may be answered,
that we are not as yet so far advanced
in these Discoveries as to render them
conducive to the Service of Mankind.
Perfection in any Branch of Philosophy
is to be attained but by slow Gradations.
It is our Duty to be still going
forward; the rest we must leave to the
Direction of that Providence, which
we know assuredly, has created nothing
in vain. But I make no Scruple to assert,
that notwithstanding the great Advances,
which have been made in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_v' id='Page_v'>v</a></span>
part of natural Philosophy within these
few Years, many and great Properties
remain still undiscover'd. Future Philosophers
(some perhaps even of the present
Age) may deduce from electrical
Experiments, Uses extremely beneficial
to Society in general.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>NO present Advantage accrued to
those Persons, or to that Age, which first
discover'd the Properties of the Magnet.
Many hundreds of Years intervened,
before they were applied to the
great Uses of Navigation. Had these
remain'd a secret till now, what other
Methods could have been substituted in
their Place, by which we could securely
traverse the vast Ocean? All the Advantages
we receive from distant Commerce,
we must still have been Strangers
to, but for this fortunate Application of
the magnetical Power. And even the
Discoveries thus far had been very imperfect,
without the Knowledge of the
Variation of the Compass. But the present
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_vi' id='Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
Age, and even this Nation, boasts of
a Gentleman<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, who seems to be entrusted
with the magnetical Powers themselves.
He makes artificial Magnets, increases
in a few Minutes the Powers of real
ones to a surprizing Degree, changes at
Pleasure their Poles, and makes that
newly acquired Polarity, permanent.
The World, I hope, will not long be deprived
of the Manner, by which these
extraordinary Changes are produced,
which as yet this Gentleman thinks proper
to conceal. As Electricity has some Properties
in common with Magnetism, as
will be shewn in the Course of these Observations;
some new Lights probably
may be thrown upon both. But to return;
admitting even, that no substantial
Advantages could arise from the Inquiries
before us, (which, however, we can
by no means grant, upon our considering
the Effects we already perceive of its
Operations upon human Bodies) whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_vii' id='Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
tends to enlarge the Conceptions of the
Mind, and to implant in us still more
lofty Ideas of the Almighty Author of
Nature, deserves certainly, independent
of other Considerations, our highest Regard.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>THESE Experiments were all made
with Glass Tubes of about two Foot long;
the bore about an Inch in Diameter.
But a scrupulous Exactness in these Proportions
is no ways necessary. The
thinner and lighter these Tubes are, the
sooner they are excited; though they, 'tis
true, don't retain their Power so long as
those, which are more thick and substantial.
But where you intend to communicate
the electrical Power, as fast as
you excite it, I should prefer a light
Tube; though it ought never to be less
than 1/12 of an Inch thick, because of the
Danger of breaking it by the Friction.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>THE Tube, before it is rubbed,
should be always made dry and warm,
which may be done by laying it before
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_viii' id='Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
the Fire. But I cannot omit hereupon
making one further Remark</i>; viz. <i>that
Glass Tubes, exactly of the same Dimensions,
made at the same Time, and
with the same Materials, vary considerably
with regard to their fitness for electrical
Purposes. Clear and dry Air with
some degree of cold is most eligible, though
I have succeeded in the greatest Fogs, but
with more Difficulty.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>THE Society having heard
from some of their Correspondents
in <i>Germany</i>, that
what they call a Vegetable Quintessence
had been fired by Electricity,
I take this Opportunity to acquaint
you, that on <i>Friday</i> Evening last I
succeeded, after having been disappointed
in many Attempts, in setting
Spirits of Wine on Fire by that Power.
The preceding Part of the Week
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
had been remarkably warm, and the Air
very dry, than which nothing is more
necessary towards the Success of Electrical
Trials; to these I may add, that the
Wind was then Easterly and inclining
to freeze. I that Evening used a glass
Sphere as well as a Tube; but I always
find myself capable of sending forth
much more Fire from the Tube than
from the Sphere, probably from not
being sufficiently used to the last.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I had</span> before observ'd, that although<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
Non-electric Bodies made
electrical, lose almost all that Electricity
by coming either within
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
or near the Contact of <i>Non-electrics</i>
not made electrical; it happens
otherwise with Regard to <i>Electrics
per se</i>, when excited by rubbing, patting,
<i>&amp;c</i>; because from the rubbed
Tube I can sometimes procure five or
six Flashes from different Parts, as
though the Tube of two Foot long,
instead of being one continued Cylinder,
consisted of five or six separate
Segments of Cylinders, each of which
gave out its Electricity at a different
Explosion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> Knowledge of this Theorem
is of the utmost Consequence towards
the Success of electrical Experiments;
inasmuch as you must endeavour by all
possible Means to collect the Whole of
this Fire at the same Time. Professor
<i>Hollman</i> seems to have endeavour'd at
this and succeeded, by having a tin
Tube, in one End of which he put a
great many Threads, whose Extremities
touch'd the Sphere when in Motion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
and each Thread collected a Quantity
of electrical Fire, the Whole of
which center'd in the tin Tube, and
went off at the other Extremity. Another
Thing to be observ'd, is to endeavour
to make the Flashes follow
each other so fast, as that a Second
may be visible before the First is extinguish'd.
When you transmit the electrical
Fire along a Sword or other Instrument,
whose Point is sharp, it often
appears as a Number of disseminated
Sparks, like wet Gunpowder or
<i>Wild-fire</i>; but if the Instrument has
no Point, you generally perceive a
pure bright Flame, like what is vulgarly
call'd the <i>Blue-ball</i>, which gives
the Appearance of Stars to fired
Rockets.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> following is the Method I
made use of and was happy enough to
succeed in. I suspended a Poker in
silk Lines; at the Handle of which I
hung several little Bundles of white
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
Thread, the Extremities of which
were about a Foot at right Angles
from the Poker. Among these
Threads, which were all attracted by
the rubbed Tube, I excited the greatest
electrical Fire I was capable, whilst
an Assistant near the End of the Poker
held in his Hand a Spoon, in which
were the warm Spirits. Thus the Thread
communicated the Electricity to the
Poker, and the Spirit was fired at the
other End. It must be observ'd in this
Experiment, that the Spoon with the
Spirit must not touch the Poker; if it
does, the Electricity without any
flashing is communicated to the Spoon,
and to the Assistant in whose Hand it
is held, and so is lost in the Floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>By these Means, I fired several
Times not only the ætherial Liquor or
Phlogiston of <i>Frobenius</i> and rectified
Spirit of Wine, but even common
proof Spirit. These Experiments, as
I before observ'd, were made last <i>Friday</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
Night, the Air being perfectly
dry. <i>Sunday</i> proved wet and <i>Monday</i>
somewhat warm, so that the Air was
full of Vapour; Wind South-West and
cloudy. Under these Disadvantages,
on <i>Monday</i> Night I attempted again
my Experiments; they succeeded, but
with infinitely more Labour than the
preceeding, because of the Unfitness
of the Evening for such Trials. <i>Your
Candour</i> will not permit you to think
my Minuteness trivial, with Regard
to the Circumstances of the Weather,
who know, how many Things must
concur to make these Experiments succeed.
I shall wait with Impatience
for a proper Opportunity to have these
Experiments repeated in your Presence,
and am, with the utmost Respect,</p>

<p class='c006'>I lately acquainted you, that
I had been able to fire Spirit of
Wine, <i>Phlogiston</i> of <i>Frobenius</i>, and
common proof Spirit, by the Power
of Electricity. Since which (till Yesterday)
we have had but one very dry
fine Day; <i>viz.</i> <i>Monday, April 15</i>.
Wind E. N. E.; when about four o'Clock
in the Afternoon, I got my <i>Apparatus</i>
ready, and fired the Spirit of
Wine four Times from the Poker as
before, three Times from the Finger
of a Person electrified, standing upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
a Cake of Wax, and once from the
Finger of a second Person standing upon
Wax, communicating with the
first by means of a walking Cane held
between their Arms extended. The
horizontal Distance in this Case between
the glass Tube and the Spirit
was at least ten Feet.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> all know, that there is the repulsive
Power of Electricity, as well
as the attractive; inasmuch as you
are able, when a Feather or such-like
light Substance is replete with Electricity,
to drive it about a Room,
which Way you please. This repulsive
Power continues, until either the
Tube loses its excited Force, or the
Feather attracts the Moisture from
the Air, or comes near to some non-electric
Substance; if so, the Feather
is attracted by, and its Electricity lost in,
whatever Non-Electric it comes near.
In electrified Bodies, you see a perpetual
Endeavour to get rid of their Electricity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
This induced me to make
the following Experiment. I placed
a Man upon a Cake of Wax, who
held in one of his Hands a Spoon with
the warm Spirits, and in the other a
Poker with the Thread. I rubbed the
Tube amongst the Thread, and electrified
him as before. I then ordered a
Person not electrified to bring his Finger
near the Middle of the Spoon;
upon which, the Flash from the Spoon
and Spirit was violent enough to fire
the Spirit. This Experiment I then
repeated three Times. In this Method,
the Person by whose Finger the
Spirit of Wine is fired, feels the Stroke
much more violent, than when the
electrical Fire goes from him to the
Spoon. This Method for the Sake of
Distinction, we will call the repulsive
Power of Electricity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> late Dr. <i>Desaguliers</i> has observed
in his excellent Dissertation concerning
Electricity, "That there is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
Sort of Capriciousness attending
these Experiments, or something unaccountable
in their Phænomena,
not to be reduced to any Rule.
For sometimes an Experiment,
which has been made several Times
successively, will all at once fail."
Now I imagine that the greatest Part,
if not the Whole of this Matter, depends
upon the Moisture or Dryness of
the Air, a sudden though slight Alteration
in which, perhaps not sufficient
to be obvious to our Faculties, may
be perceived by the very subtle Fire of
Electricity. For</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, <span class='sc'>I conceive</span>, that the Air itself
(as has been observed by Dr. <i>Desaguliers</i>)
is an <i>Electric per se</i> and of
the vitreous Kind; therefore it repels
the Electricity arising from the glass
Tube, and disposes it to electrify whatever
non-electrical Bodies receive the
Effluvia from the Tube.</p>

<p class='c006'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
<i>2dly</i>, <span class='sc'>That</span> Water is a <i>non-Electric</i>,
and of Consequence a Conductor of
Electricity; this is exemplified by a Jett
of Water being attracted by the Tube,
<i>from either Electric</i>'s <i>per se</i> conducting
Electricity, and <i>non-Electric</i>'s more
readily when wetted; but what is
more to my present Purpose, is, that if
you only blow through a dry glass
Tube, the Moisture from your Breath
will cause that Tube to be a Conductor
of Electricity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>These</span> being premised; in proportion
as the Air is replete with watery
Vapours, the Electricity arising from
the Tube, instead of being conducted
as proposed, is, by means of these Vapours,
communicated to the circum-ambient
Atmosphere and dissipated as
fast as excited.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>This</span> Theory has been confirmed
to me by divers Experiments, but by
none more remarkably than on the Evening
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
of the Day I made those before-mention'd;
when the Vapours,
which in the Afternoon by the Sun's
Heat, and a brisk Gale were dissipated,
and the Air perfectly dry, descended
again in great Plenty upon the Absence
of both, and the Evening was very
damp. For between seven and eight
o'Clock, I attempted again the same
Experiments in the same Manner,
without being able to make any of
them succeed; though all those mention'd
in this Paper with others of less
Note, were made in Half an Hour's
Time.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I am</span> the more particular in this,
being willing to save the Labour of
those, who are desirous of making
these Kind of Trials; for although
some of the lesser Experiments may
succeed almost at any Time, yet I never
could find that the more remarkable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
ones would succeed but in dry
Weather.</p>

<span class='sc'>How</span> far strictly speaking the Spirit
in this Operation may be said to be
fired by the repulsive Power of Electricity,
or how far that Power, which
repels light Substances when fully impregnated
with Electricity, fires the
Spirit, may probably be the Subject of
a future Inquiry; but as I am unwilling
to introduce more Terms into
any Demonstration than what are absolutely
necessary for the more ready
Conception thereof, and as inflammable
Substances may be fired by Electricity
two different Ways, let the following
Definitions at present suffice of
each of these Methods.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> first give me Leave to premise,
that no inflammable Substances
will take fire, when brought into or
near the Contact of <i>Electrics per se</i>
excited to Electricity. This Effect must
be produced by non-electrical Substances
impregnated with Electricity received
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
from the exciting <i>Electrics per
se</i>. But to return,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, <span class='sc'>I suppose</span> that inflammable
Substances are fired by the attractive
Power of Electricity, when this Effect
arises from their being brought
near excited non-Electrics.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, <span class='sc'>That</span> inflammable Substances
are fired by the repulsive Power of
Electricity; when it happens, that the
inflammable Substances, being first electrified
themselves, are fired by being
brought near non-Electrics not excited.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>This</span> Matter will be better illustrated
by an Example. Suppose that
either a Man standing upon a Cake of
Wax, or a Sword suspended in silk
Lines are electrified, and the Spirit,
being brought near them, is fired, this
is said to be perform'd by the attractive
Power of Electricity. But if the
Man electrified as before holds a Spoon
in his Hand containing the Spirit, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
the same Spoon and Spirit are placed
upon the Sword, and a Person not electrified
applies his Finger near the
Spoon, and the Spirit is fired from the
Flame arising from the Spoon and
Spirit upon such Application; this I
call being fired by the repulsive Power.
Of the two mention'd Kinds I generally
find the repulsive Power
strongest.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Since</span> my last Communication, the
Spirit has been fired both by the attractive
and repulsive Power through
four Persons standing upon electrical
Cakes; each communicating with the
other either by the Means of a walking
Cane, a Sword, or any other non-electric
Substance. It has likewise
been fired from the Handle of a Sword
held in the Hand of a third Person.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I have</span> not only fired <i>Frobenius</i>'s
Phlogiston, rectified-spirit and common
proof-spirit, but also Sal volatile
Oleosum, Spirit of Lavender, dulcified
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
Spirit of Nitre, Peony Water, <i>Daffy</i>'s
Elixir, <i>Helvetius</i>'s Stiptic, and some
other Mixtures where the Spirit has
been very considerably diluted; likewise
distilled vegetable Oils, such as
that of Turpentine, Lemon, Orange
Peels and Juniper, and even those of
them, which are specifically heavier
than Water, as Oil of Sassafras; also
resinous Substances, such as Balsam Capivi
and Turpentine; all which send
forth, when warmed, an inflammable
Vapour. But expressed vegetable Oils,
as those of Olives, Linseed, and Almonds,
as well as Tallow, all whose
Vapours are uninflammable, I have
not been able yet to fire; but these indeed
will not fire on the Application
of lighted Paper. Besides, if these
last would fire with lighted Paper,
unless their Vapours were inflammable,
I can scarce conceive they would
fire by Electricity; because in firing
Spirits, <i>&amp;c.</i> I always perceive that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
Electricity snaps before it comes in
Contact with their Surfaces, and therefore
only fires their inflammable Vapours.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span> an excited non-Electric emits
almost all its Fire, if once touch'd by
a non-Electric not excited, I was desirous
of being satisfy'd, whether or
no the Fire emitted would not be
greater or less in proportion to the Volume
of the electrified Body. In order
to this I procur'd an Iron Bar
about five Feet long and near 170
Pounds in Weight; this I electrified
lying on Cakes of Wax and Rosin,
but observed the Flashes arising therefrom
not more violent than those from
a common Poker. In making this
Experiment, being willing to try the
repulsive Force, it once happen'd that
whilst the Bar was at one End electrifying,
a Spoon lay upon the other,
and upon an Assistant's pouring some
warm Spirit into the Spoon, the electrical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
Flash from the Spoon snapped
and fired the first Drop of the Spirit,
which unexpectedly fired not only the
whole Jett as it was pouring, but kindled
likewise the whole Quantity in
the Pot, in which I usually have it
warm'd.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I find</span>, in firing inflammable Substances
from the Finger of a Man
standing upon Wax, that <i>cæteris paribus</i>
the Success is more constant, if
the Man instead of holding the Thread
(the Use of which I communicated in
a former Paper) in his Hand, the
Thread is suspended at the End of an
Iron Rod held in one Hand, and he
touches the Spirit with one of the
Fingers of the other.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> a Man, standing upon the electrical
Cake with a Dish or deep Plate
of Water in one Hand, and the Iron
Rod with the Thread in the other, is
made electrical; and a Person not electrified
touches any Part either of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
Plate or Water, the Flashes of Fire
come out plentifully, and wherever
you bring your Finger very near, the
Water rises up in a little Cone, from
the Point of which the Fire is produced,
and your Finger, though not in
actual Contact, is made wet. The
same Experiment succeeds through
three or more People.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> firing inflammable Substances,
the Person who holds the Spoon in his
Hand to receive the electrical Flashes,
when the Finger of the electrified
Person is brought near thereto, not
only feels a tingling in his Hand, but
even a slight Pain up to his Elbow.
This is most perceptible in dry Weather,
when the Electricity is very
powerful.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a considerable Difficulty
in firing <i>Electrics per se</i>, such as Turpentine,
and Balsam Capivi, by the repulsive
Power of Electricity; because
in this Case these Substances will not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
permit the Electricity to pass through
them; therefore when you would have
this Experiment succeed, the Finger
of the Person, who is to fire them, is to
be applied as near to the Edge as possible
of these Substances when warm'd
in a Spoon, that the Flashes from the
Spoon (for these Substances will emit
none) may snap, where they are
spread the thinnest, and then fire their
Effluvia. This Experiment, as well
as several others, serves to confute
that Opinion, which has prevail'd with
many, that the Electricity floats only
upon the Surfaces of Bodies.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> an electrical Cake is dipp'd in
Water, it is thereby made a Conductor
of Electricity, the Water hanging about
it transmitting the electrical Effluvia
in such a manner, that a Person
standing thereon can by no means be
electrified enough to attract the leaf
Gold at the smallest Distance; though
the Person standing upon the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
Cake when dry, attracted a Piece of
fine Thread hanging at the Distance
of two Feet from his Finger. We
must here observe that the Cake being
of an unctuous Substance, the Water
will no where lie uniformly thereon,
but adhere in separate Moleculæ; so
that in this Instance the Electricity
jumps from one Particle of Water to
another, till the Whole is dissipated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>From</span> the Appearance of the
Threads amongst which I rub the
Tube, I can frequently judge, though
the Spirit may be many Feet distant
from them, whether or no it will fire;
because when the Persons standing upon
the Wax are made electrical enough
to fire the Spirit, the Threads repel
each other at their lower Parts, where
they are not confin'd, to a considerable
Distance, and this Distance is in
Proportion as the Threads are made
electrical.</p>

<p class='c006'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
<span class='sc'>If</span> two Persons stand upon electrical
Cakes at about a Yard's Distance from
each other, one of which Persons, for
the Sake of Distinction, we will call A,
the other B: If A when electrified
touches B, A loses almost all his Electricity
at that Touch only, which is receiv'd
by B and stopp'd by the electrical
Cake; if A is immediately electrified
again to the same Degree as before
and touches B, the Snapping is less upon
the Touch; and this Snapping, upon
electrifying A, grows less and less,
till B being impregnated with Electricity,
though receiv'd at Intervals, the
Snapping will no longer be sensible.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>That</span> Glass will repel and not conduct
the Electricity of Glass, has been
mention'd by others, who have treated
of this Subject; but the Experiments
to determine this Matter must be conducted
with a great deal of Caution;
for unless the glass Tube, intended to
conduct the Electricity, be as warm as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
the external Air, it will seem to prove
the contrary, unless in very dry Places
and Seasons. Thus, I sometimes have
brought a cold, though dry, Glass
Tube near three Feet long into a
Room, where there has been a Number
of People; when upon placing
the Tube upon Silk Lines, and laying
some Leaf Silver upon a Card at one
End and rubbing another Glass Tube
at the other, the Silver has, contrary to
Expectation, been thrown off as readily
as from an Iron Rod. At first I was
surpriz'd at this Appearance, but then
conjectur'd, that it must arise from the
Coldness of the Glass, condensing the
floating Vapour of the Room; in Order
then to obviate this, I warm'd the
Tube sufficiently, and this Effect was
no longer produced, but the Silver lay
perfectly still.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> a Number of Pieces of finely
spun Glass cut to about an Inch
in Length, little bits of fine Wire of
the same Length of what Metal you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
please, and small Cork Balls, are either
put all together, or each by themselves,
into a dry pewter Plate, or
upon a Piece of polish'd Metal, they
make in the following Manner a very
odd and surprizing Appearance. Let
a Man, standing upon electrical Cakes,
hold this Plate in his Hand with the
bits of Glass, Wire, <i>&amp;c.</i> detached
from each other, as much as conveniently
may be; when he is electrified,
let him cause a Person standing upon
the Ground to bring another Plate, his
Hand, or any other Non-Electric, exactly
over the Plate containing these
Bodies. When his Hand, <i>&amp;c.</i> is about
eight Inches over them, let him bring
it down gently: As it comes near, in
proportion to the Strength of the Electricity,
he will observe the bits of
Glass first raise themselves upright;
and then, if he brings his Hand nearer,
dart directly up and stick to it without
snapping. The bits of Wire will
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
fly up likewise, and as they come near
the Hand, snap aloud; you feel a
smart Stroke, and see the Fire arising
from them to the Hand at every Stroke;
each of these, as soon as they have discharged
their Fire, falls down again
upon the Plate. The Cork Balls also
fly up, and strike your Hand, but fall
again directly. You have a constant
Succession of these Appearances as
long as you continue to electrify the
Man, in whose Hand the Plate is held;
but if you touch any part either of the
Man or Plate, the Pieces of Glass,
which before were upon their Ends,
immediately fall down.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Some</span> few Years ago, Sir <i>James
Lowther</i> brought some Bladders fill'd
with inflammable Air, collected from
his Coal-mines, to the Royal Society.
This Air flam'd upon a lighted Candle
being brought near it. This Inflammability
has occasion'd many terrible
Accidents. Mr. <i>Maud</i>, a worthy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
Member of this Society, made at
that Time by Art, and shew'd the
Society, Air exactly of the same Quality.
I was desirous of knowing if
this Air would be kindled by electrical
Flashes. I accordingly made such
Air by putting an Ounce of Filings of
Iron, an Ounce of Oil of Vitriol and
four Ounces of Water into a Florence
Flask; upon which an Ebullition ensued,
and the Air, which arose from
these Materials, not only fill'd three
Bladders, but also, upon the Application
of the Finger of an Electrified
Person, took Flame and burnt near the
Top and out of the Neck of the
Flask a considerable Time. When
the Flame is almost out, shake the
Flask and the Flame revives. You
must with your Finger dipped in Water,
moisten the Mouth of the Flask
as fast as it is dried by the Heat within,
or the Electricity will not fire it: Because
the Flask being an Electric <i>per
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
se</i> will not snap at the Application of
the Finger, without the Glass being
first made non-electric by wetting. It
has sometimes happen'd, if the Finger
has been applied before the inflammable
Air has found a ready Exit
from the Mouth of the Flask, that
the Flash has fill'd the Flask, and gone
off with an Explosion equal to the
firing of a large Pistol, and sometimes
indeed it has burst the Flask. The
same Effect is produced from the Spirit
of Sea Salt, as from Oil of Vitriol;
but as the Acid of Sea Salt is
much lighter than that of Vitriol, there
is no Necessity to add the Water in
this Experiment.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Those</span> who are not much acquainted
with Chemical Philosophy, may
think it very extraordinary, that from
a Mixture of cold Substances, which
both conjunctly and separately are uninflammable,
this very inflammable
Vapour should be produced. In order
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
to solve this, it may not be improper
to premise, that Iron is compounded
of a Metallic as well as a sulphurous
Part. This Sulphur is so fix'd,
that, after heating the Iron red hot,
and even melting it ever so often, the
Sulphur will not be disengaged therefrom:
But upon the Mixture of the
Vitriolic Acid, and by the Heat and
Ebullition which are almost instantly
produced, the Metallic Part is dissolved,
and the Sulphur, which before
was intimately connected therewith,
being disengaged, becomes volatile.
This Heat and Ebullition continues
'till the Vitriolic Acid is perfectly saturated
with the Metallic Part of the
Iron, and the Vapour once fired continues
to flame, until this Saturation
being effected, no more of the Sulphur
flies off.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I have</span> heretofore mentioned, how
considerably perfectly dry Air conduces
to the Success of these Experiments;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
but we have been lately informed
by an Extract of a Letter, that
<i>Abbé Nolet</i> was of Opinion, that they
would succeed in wet Weather, provided
the Tubes were made of Glass,
tinged blue with Zaffer. I have procured
Tubes of this Sort, but, after
giving them many candid Trials, I
cannot think them equal to their Recommendation.
I first tried one of
them in a smart Shower of Rain after
a dry Day, when the Drops were
large, and the Spirit fired three Times
in about four Minutes; the same Effect
succeeded, under the same Circumstances,
from the white one; but
after three or four Hours raining,
when the Air was perfectly wet, I never
could make it succeed. And to
illustrate this Matter further, I have
been able when the Weather has been
very dry, with once rubbing my Hand
down this blue Tube, and applying it
to the End of an Iron Rod six Feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
long, to throw off several Pieces of
Leaf-Silver lying upon a Card at the
other End of this Rod, whereas I never
have been able to throw it off by
any Means in very wet Weather. Besides,
I am of Opinion, that after the
Electrical Fire is gone from the Tube,
the Tube has no Share in the conducting
of it; my Sentiments on that
Head I laid before you in a former Paper:
For if the Silk Lines are wetted,
they diffuse all the Electricity, and the
same Effects happen when the Air is
wet, be your Glass of what Colour
it will. It may not be improper here
to observe, that Zaffer, which is
used by the Glass-makers and Enamellers,
is made of Cobalt or Mundick
calcin'd after the subliming the
Flowers. This being reduced to a very
fine Powder, and mixt with twice
or thrice its own Weight of finely
powdered Flints, is moisten'd with
Water and put up in Barrels, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
it soon runs into a hard Mass and is
call'd Zaffer.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A dry</span> Sponge hanging by a Pack-thread
at the End of an electrified
Sword, or from the Hand of an electrified
Man, gives no Signs of being
made electrical; if it is well soak'd
in Water, wherever it is touched, you
both see and feel the electrical Sparks.
Not only so, but if it is so full of
Water, that it falls from the Sponge,
those Drops in a dark Room, receiv'd
upon your Hand, not only flash and
snap, but you perceive a pricking
Pain. If you hold your Hand, or any
non-electrical Substances, very
near, the Water which had ceased
dropping when the Sponge was not
electrified, drops again upon its being
electrified, and the Drops fall in Proportion
to the receiv'd Electricity, as
though the Sponge were gently
squeez'd between your Fingers. I
was desirous to know if I was able to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
electrify a Drop of cold Water, dropping
from the Sponge, enough to fire
the Spirit; but after many unsuccessful
Trials, I was forced to desist; because
the cold Water dropping from
the Sponge not only cool'd the Spirit
too much, but also render'd it too
weak; likewise, every Drop carried
with it great Part of the Electricity
from the Sponge. I then consider'd,
in what Manner, I could give a Tenacity
to the Water, sufficient to
make the Drops hang a considerable
Time, and this I brought about by
making a Mucilage of the Seeds of
Fleawort. A wet Sponge then,
squeez'd hard and fill'd with this
cold Mucilage, was held in the Hand
of an electrified Man, when the Drops
forced out by the Electricity, assisted
by the Tenacity of the Liquor, hung
some Inches from the Sponge, and by
a Drop of this I fir'd not only the
Spirit of Wine, but likewise the inflammable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
Air before mentioned, both
with and without the Explosion.
What an extraordinary Effect is this!
That a Drop of cold Water (for the
Seeds contribute nothing but add
Consistence to the Water) should be
the Medium of Fire and Flame.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Camphor</span> is a vegetable Resin, and
of Consequence an Electric <i>per se</i>.
This Substance, notwithstanding its
great Inflammability, will not take
fire from the Finger of a Man or any
other Body electrified, though made
very warm and the Vapours arise therefrom
in great Abundance. Because,
neither Electric's <i>per se</i> excited, or electrified
Bodies, exert their Force by
snapping upon Electric's <i>per se</i>, though
not excited. If you break Camphor
small and warm it in a Spoon, it is not
melted by Heat like other Resins; but
if that Heat were continued it would
all prove volatile. To Camphor thus
warm'd, the Finger of an electrified
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
Man, a Sword or such-like, will in
snapping exert its Force upon the
Spoon, and the circum-ambient Vapour
of the Camphor will be fired
thereby, and light up the whole
Quantity exposed. The same Experiment
succeeds by the repulsive Power
of Electricity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A Poker</span> thoroughly ignited put
into Spirit of Wine, or into the distilled
Oil of Vegetables, produces
no Flame in either; it indeed occasions
the Vapours to arise from the Oil
in great Abundance. But if you
electrify this heated Poker, the electrical
Flashes presently kindle Flame in
either. The Experiment is the same
with Camphor. These Experiments,
as well as the following, sufficiently
evince, that the electrical Fire is
truly Flame, and that extreamly subtil.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I have</span> made several Trials in order
to fire Gunpowder alone, which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
tried both warm and cold, whole and
powder'd, but never could make it
succeed; and this arises in part from
its Vapours not being inflammable,
and in part from its not being capable
of being fir'd by Flame, unless the
Sulphur in the Composition is nearly
in the State of Accension. This we
see by putting Gunpowder into a
Spoon with rectified Spirit, which,
when lighted, will not fire the Powder,
'till by the Heat of the Spoon
from the burning Spirit, the Sulphur
is almost melted. Likewise, if you
hold Gunpowder ground very fine in
a Spoon over a lighted Candle, or any
other Flame, as soon as the Spoon
is hot enough to melt the Sulphur,
you see a blue Flame, and instantly
the Powder flashes off. The same
Effects are observ'd in the <i>Pulvis fulminans</i>,
compos'd of Nitre, Sulphur,
and fixed Alkaline Salt. Besides, when
the Gunpowder is very dry and ground
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
very fine, it (as you please to make
the Experiment) is either attracted, or
repell'd; so that in the first Case, the
End of your Finger when electrified,
shall be cover'd over with the Powder,
though held at some Distance; and in
the other, if you electrify the Powder,
it will fly off at the Approach of any
non-electrified Substance, and sometimes
even without it. But I can at
Pleasure fire Gunpowder, and even discharge
a Musket, by the Power of
Electricity, when the Gunpowder has
been ground with a little Camphor or
with a few Drops of some inflammable
chemical Oil. This Oil somewhat
moistens the Powder, and prevents its
flying away; the Gunpowder then being
warm'd in a Spoon, the electrical
Flashes fire the inflammable Vapour,
which fires the Gunpowder: But the
Time between the Vapour firing the
Powder is so short, that frequently
they appear as the same and not successive
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
Operations, wherein the Gunpowder
itself seems fired by the Electricity;
and indeed the first Time
this Experiment succeeded, the Flash
was so sudden and unexpected, that
the Hand of my Assistant, who
touch'd the Spoon with his Finger,
was considerably scorch'd. So that
there seems a fourth Ingredient necessary
to make Gunpowder readily take
Fire by Flame, and that such a one,
as will heighten the Inflammability of
the Sulphur. In common Cases the
lighted Match or the little Portion of
red hot Glass, which falls among the
Powder, and is the Result of the Collision
from the Flint and Steel, fires
the Charcoal and Sulphur, and these
the Nitre. But if to these three Ingredients
you add a fourth, <i>viz.</i> a
Vegetable chemical Oil, and gently
warm this Mixture, the Oil by the
Warmth mixes intimately with the Sulphur,
lowers its Consistence, and makes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
it readily take fire by Flame. In these
Operations, notwithstanding I always
made use of the finest scented Oils of
Orange Peel, Lemons, and such like,
yet upon the least warming the Mixture,
the rank Smell of Balsam (<i>i. e.</i>
the ready Solution) of Sulphur was
very obvious.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span> Water is a non-electric, and of
Consequence a Conductor of
Electricity, I had Reason to believe
that Ice was endowed with the same
Properties. Upon making the Experiment
I found my Conjectures not
without Foundation; for upon electrifying
a Piece of Ice, wherever the
Ice was touched by a non-electric, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
flashed and snapped. A Piece of Ice also
held in the Hand of an electrified Man,
as in the beforementioned Processes,
fired warm Spirit, chemical vegetable
Oils, Camphor, and Gunpowder prepared
as before. But here great Care
must be taken, that by the Warmth of
the Hand, or of the Air in the Room,
the Ice does not melt; if so, every
Drop of Water therefrom considerably
diminishes the received Electricity.
In Order to obviate this, I caused my
Assistant, while he was electrifying, to
be continually wiping the Ice dry upon
a Napkin hung to the Buttons of his
Coat, and this being electrified as well
as the Ice, prevented any Loss of the
Force of the Electricity. The Experiment
will succeed likewise, if, instead
of the Ice, you electrify the Spirit,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and bring the Ice not electrified
near them. I must observe,
that Ice is not so ready a Conductor of
Electricity as Water; so that I very
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
frequently have been disappointed in
endeavouring with it to fire inflammable
Substances, when it has been
readily done by a Sword or the Finger
of a Man.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first Paper<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> I had the Honour
to lay before you upon this Subject,
I took Notice of my having observed
two different Appearances of
the Fire from electrified Substances;
<i>viz</i>. those large bright Flashes, which
may be procured from any Part of
electrified Bodies, by bringing a Non-Electric
unexcited near them, and with
which we have fired all the inflammable
Substances mentioned in the Course
of these Observations; and those, like
the firing of wet Gunpowder, which
are only perceptible at the Points or
Edges of excited Non-electrics. These
last also appear different in Colour and
Form according to the Substances from
which they proceed: For from polished
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
Bodies, as the Point of a Sword, a
Silver Probe, the Points of Scissors,
and the Edges of the Steel-bar made
Magnetical by the ingenious Dr.
<i>Knight</i>, the electrical Fire appears like
a Pencil of Rays, agreeing in Colour
with the Fire from <i>Boyle</i>'s Phosphorus;
but from unpolished Bodies, as the End
of a Poker, a rusty Nail or such-like,
the Rays are much more red. The
Difference of Colour here, I am of
Opinion, is owing rather to the different
Reflection of the electrical Fire
from the Surface of the Body from
which it is emitted, than to any Difference
in the Fire itself. These Pencils
of Rays issue successively as long
as the Bodies, from which they proceed,
are exciting; but they are longer
and more brilliant, if you bring any
Non-Electric not excited near them,
though it must not be close enough to
make them snap. If you hold your
Hand at about two or three Inches Distance
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
from these Points, you not only
feel successive Blasts of Wind from
them, but hear also a crackling Noise.
Where there are several Points, you observe
at the same Time several Pencils
of Rays.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> appears from Experiments, that
besides the several Properties, that
Electricity is possess'd of peculiar to
itself, it has some in common with
Magnetism and Light.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Proposition</span> I.</h3>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> common with Magnetism, Electricity
counteracts, and in light Substances
overcomes the Force of Gravity.
Like that extraordinary Power likewise,
it exerts its Force <i>in Vacuo</i> as
powerfully as in open Air, and this
Force is extended to a considerable Distance
through various Substances of
different Textures and Densities.</p>

<div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Corollary.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Gravity</span> is the general Endeavour
and Tendency of Bodies towards the
Center of the Earth; this is overcome
by the Magnet with Regard to Iron,
and by Electricity with Regard to
light Substances both in its Attraction
and Repulsion; but I have never been
able to discern that vortical Motion,
by which this Effect was said to be
brought about by the late Dr. <i>Desaguliers</i>
and others, having no other Conception
of its Manner of acting than
as Rays from a Center, which indeed
is confirmed by several Experiments.
One of which, very easy to be tried,
is, that if a single downy Seed of Cotton
Grass is dropped from a Man's
Hand, and in its Fall comes within
the Attraction of the rubbed Tube;
the Down of this Seed, which before
seemed to stick together, separates, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
forms Rays round the Center of the Seed:
Or if you fasten many of these Seeds
with Mucilage of Gum Arabic, round a
Bit of Stick, the Down of them when
electrified, which otherwise hangs from
the Stick, is raised up, and forms a circular
Appearance round the Stick. As
these light Bodies are directed in their
Motions, only by the Force impressed
upon them, and as their Appearance is
constantly <i>radiatim</i>, such Appearance
by no Means squares with our Idea of
a Vortex. Some have imagined a Polarity
also, when they have observed
one end of an excited Glass Tube repel
light Substances, and the other attract
them. But this Deception, arising
from the whole Length of the
Tube not being excited, but only such
Part of it as has been rubbed; so that
as much of the Tube as is held in the
Hand, remains in an unexcited State,
and permits light Substances to lie still
thereon, though forcibly repell'd at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
the other End. This attractive Power
of Electricity acts not only upon
Non-electrics, as Leaf-Gold, Silver,
Thread, and such like, but also upon
originally Electrics, as Silk, dry
Feathers, little Pieces of Glass and
Resin; it attracts all Bodies, that are
not of the same Standard of Electricity,
(if I may be allowed the Expression)
as the excited Body from which
it proceeds. I have found no Body
however dense, whose Pores are not
pervious to Electricity by a proper Management,
not even Gold itself.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Proposition II.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> common with Light, Electricity
pervades Glass, but suffers no Refraction
therefrom; I having from the
most exact Observations found its Direction
to be in right Lines, and that
through Glasses of different Forms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
included one within the other, and
large Spaces left between each Glass.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Corollary.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>This</span> rectilineal Direction is observable
only as far as the Electricity can
penetrate through unexcited Originally-electrics,
and those perfectly dry;
nor is it at all material, whether these
Substances are transparent, as Glass;
semidiaphanous, as Porcelain or thin
Cakes of white Wax; or quite opake,
as thick woollen Cloth, as well as woven
Silk of various Colours; it is only
necessary that they be Originally-electrics.
But the Case is widely different
with Regard to Non-electrics; wherein
the Direction, given to the Electricity
by the excited originally-electric,
is alter'd as soon as it touches
the Surface of a Non-electric, and is
propagated with a Degree of Swiftness
scarcely to be measured in all possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
Directions to impregnate the
whole Non-electric Mass in Contact
with it, or nearly so, however different
in itself, and which must of Necessity
be terminated by an originally
Electric, before the Electricity exerts
the least Attraction, and then this
Power is observed first at that Part of
the Non-electric the most remote from
the originally-electric. Thus for Example,
by an excited Tube held
over it, Leaf Gold will be attracted
through Glass, Cloth, <i>&amp;c.</i> held horizontally
in the Hand of a Man
standing upon the Floor, and this Attraction
is exerted to a considerable
Distance. On the contrary, the rubbed
Tube will not attract Leaf Gold
or other light Bodies, however near,
through Silver, Tin, the thinnest Board,
Paper, or any other Non-electric, held
in the Manner before-mentioned. But
if you rub the Paper over with Wax
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
melted, and by that Means introduce
the originally-electric therein, you
observe the Electricity acts in right
Lines, and attracts powerfully. And
here I must beg Leave to remind you,
not only of the former Corollary, but
of some of the former Experiments
also; by which it appears, that although,
to make a Non-electric exert any
Power, we must excite the whole
Mass thereof, yet we can excite what
Part, and what only, of an originally-electric
we please. Thus we observe,
that Leaf-gold, and the Seed of Cotton-grass,
(which grows upon Boggs
and is a very proper Subject for these
Inquiries) are attracted under a Glass
Jar made warm<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, and turned Bottom
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
upwards, upon which are placed
Books and several other Non-electrics;
and that the Motions of the light Bodies
underneath correspond with the
Motions of the Glass Tube held over
them, the Electricity seeming instantaneously
to pass through the Books
and the Glass. But this does not happen,
till the Electricity has fully impregnated
the Non-electrics, which lie
upon the Glass, which received Electricity
is stopped by the Glass, and then
these Non-electrics dart their Power
directly through the upper Part of
the Glass after the Manner of Originally-electrics.
But if the thinnest
Non-electric, even the finest Paper, as
I before mentioned, is held in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
Hand of a Man at the smallest Distance
over the Leaf-Gold, and the
Electricity is not stopped, not the least
Power will be exerted, and the Gold
will lie still. I must here remark
likewise, that this Law of Electricity
is so constant and regular, that I have
not found one Deviation from it; so
that even the Quicksilver, spread thin
as it usually is at the Back of a Plate
of a Looking-glass, will prevent the
passing through of the electrical Attraction,
unless stopped by an Originally-electric.
This Penetration of the
electrical Power through originally-electrics
is much greater than has hitherto
been imagined, and has caused
the Want of Success to great Numbers
of Experiments. I have been at
no small Pains to determine, how far
this Power can penetrate through a dry
Originally-electric; and have found
by repeated Trials, that either in a
Cake of Wax alone, or of Wax and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
Resin mixed, when the Electricity is
very powerful, it has passed, I say, in
straight Lines through these Cakes of
the Thickness of 2 Inches and 4/10; but
I never could make it act through one
of 2 Inches 8/10, for in this it was perfectly
stopped. So that the Cakes
commonly made use of to stop the
Electricity, by being too thin, suffer a
considerable Quantity of the electrical
Power to pervade them, and be lost
in the Floor. I make no Doubt, if
the electrical Power could be more increased,
it would penetrate much further
through these Originally-electric
Bodies.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Proposition III.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Electricity</span>, in common with
Light likewise, when its Forces are
collected and a proper Direction given
thereto upon a proper Object, produces
Fire and Flame.</p>

<div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>COROLLARY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> Fire of Electricity (as I have
before observed) is extremely delicate,
and sets on Fire, as far as I have yet
experienced, only inflammable Vapours.
Nor is this Flame at all
heightned by being superinduced upon
an Iron Rod, red hot with coarser
culinary Fire, as in a preceeding Experiment;
nor diminished by being directed
upon cold Water. However I
was desirous of knowing, if this Flame
would be effected by a still greater Degree
of Cold; and in order to determine
this, I made an artificial Cold; by
which the Mercury, in a very nice
Thermometer adjusted to <i>Fahrenheit</i>'s
Scale, was depressed in about 4 Minutes
from 15 Degrees above the
freezing Point to 30 Degrees below it,
that is, the Mercury fell 45 Degrees.
From this cold Mixture, when electrified,
the Flashes were as powerful and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
the Stroke as smart as from the red hot
Iron. I could have made the Cold
more intense, but the above was sufficient
for my Purpose. This Experiment
seems to indicate, that the Fire
of Electricity is affected neither by the
Presence or Absence of other Fire.
For as red hot Iron, by Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>'s
Scale of Heat, is fixed at 192
Degrees, and as the Ratio between Sir
<i>Isaac</i>'s Degrees and <i>Fahrenheit</i>'s is as
34 to 180, it necessarily follows,
that the Difference of Heat between
the hot Iron and the cold Mixture is
1040 Degrees; and nevertheless this
vast Difference makes no Alteration
in the Appearance of the electrical
Flame. We find likewise, that as the
Fire, arising from the Refraction of
the Rays of Light by a <i>Lens</i>, and
brought to a <i>Focus</i>, is observed first
at some small Distance from their Surfaces,
to set on Fire combustible Substances;
the same Effect, as I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
before observ'd, is produced in like
Manner by electrical Flame.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I may</span> perhaps be thought too minute
in some of the before-mentioned
Particulars; but in Inquiries abstruse
as these are, where we have so little <i>a
priori</i> to direct us, the greatest Attention
must be had to every Circumstance,
if we are truly desirous of investigating
the Laws of this surprizing
Power. For, as has been said upon another
Occasion by my ever honoured
Friend <span class='sc'>Martin Folkes</span>, Esq; our
most worthy President, "that Electricity
seems to furnish an inexhaustible
Fund for Inquiry; and sure
Phænomena so various and so wonderful
can arise only from Causes very
general and extensive, and such as
must have been designed by the Almighty
Author of Nature for the
Production of very great Effects, and
such as are of great Moment to the
System of the Universe."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>

<p class='c006'>I have constantly observed, that the electrical

This Effect may proceed from a two-fold Cause:
First, warm Glass does not condense the Water
